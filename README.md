# Prime-Factorization

### History

I had this idea while looking at an image of a number chart. I'm pretty sure that it was quite colorful, and then I thought, what if the colors actually told you something about the number? So I thought what better than prime factorization. I actually had this idea months before I started working on it because I didn't know of the existence of conic gradients, which makes this much easier than if it didn't exist. Then I got to working on it sometime in January 2025. I accidentally deleted the code in February but remade it within a day because it was actually very simple, I was just bad at javascript (probably still am idk) so it took me month.

### What It Does

You will notice that the prime numbers have only one color in their background. The background color of each prime is unique (or not, see the last paragraph) and this color is used for the backgrounds of numbers whose prime factorization contains the prime. For some numbers, such as 12, there are more of one number in its prime factorization than others, and so it takes up more of its background.

### Things to be Fixed

It's pretty much exactly what I wanted it to be but there are a few things that I would like to change in the future (keyword, *future*). Here's a cool list:

* right now, when you generate numbers over 10, it gives a random color to the primes. These colors are randomly chosen (or so they say) but the problem is, that by incredible chance, you might get two same colors for different primes. There's nothing there to stop it from happening. And even if they are not exactly identical, some colors are indistinguishable from each other by the human eye. If I were to fix this, there would be a limit to how many numbers can be generated.

* All numbers except for 1 and 7 are white in font color. This makes them difficult to see under brighter colors. 7 was originally white too but I changed it because it was difficult to see. I want to make it so that the colors of the text depends on the background.
